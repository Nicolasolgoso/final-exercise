* It will give you the mean and the standard deviation
  
* Then it will give you three options, you have to choose one entering a number from 1 to 3
  
* If you choose 1 you will have to enter the null hypothesis mean and it will give you test statistic that  tells you how much your data deviates from the null hypothesis and the p value that provides a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis
  
* If you choose 2 you will have to enter another list of data and it will give you the same things that in option one but for the two lists of data
  
* If you choose 3 its going to ask you for the frecuences observed and the frecuences spected separeted by spaces, its important that both of them have the same length for example (3 4 3) and (5 4 1) and then it will give you the test statistic that measures the discrepancy between the observed and expected frequencies and the p value.
